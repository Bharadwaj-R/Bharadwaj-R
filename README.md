### Hello There!  

I am Bharadwaj Routhu, currently pursuing ECE Undergrad at Indian Institute of Information and Technology, Trichy. I am a tech enthusiast, and I really like discovering new technologies. I do small IoT and Embedded based projects, with the goal to explore more about its applications in real life.  

My projects are mostly based on dev kits like Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano, NodeMCU-ESP8266, etc.  Currently, I am exploring the integration of IoT into Cloud Computing technologies like [Arduino Cloud](https://create.arduino.cc/iot) and [Blynk IoT Platform](https://blynk.io/), and also Graphical Programming Languages like [Processing IDE](https://processing.org/).
