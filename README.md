### Hello There!  

I am Bharadwaj Routhu, currently pursuing M.Tech at the [Indian Institute of Science Bengaluru](iisc.ac.in) in Semiconductor Technology from [CeNSE Department](http://www.cense.iisc.ac.in/). I am a tech geek and enthusiast, and I like discovering new technologies. I do small IoT and Embedded based projects, with the goal to explore more about its applications in real life.  

My projects are mostly based on dev kits like Arduino Nano, NodeMCU-ESP8266, ESP32 etc.  Currently, I am exploring the integration of IoT into Cloud technologies like [Arduino Cloud](https://create.arduino.cc/iot) and [Blynk IoT Platform](https://blynk.io/). I am also learning some advanced IoT communication protocols like [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/) and softwares like [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), [Mosquitto MQTT](https://mosquitto.org/) and [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) to establish fast, more secure and a easier connection between all of my IoT devices.
