## Bharadwaj Routhu   

### Hello There!!  
I am Bharadwaj Routhu, currently pursuing ECE Undergrad at Indian Institute of Information and Technology, Trichy. I am a tech enthusiast, and I really like discovering new technologies. Currently, I am doing IoT and Embedded based projects, and want to explore more about its applications in real life.  

My projects are mostly based on [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) Uno, and I am exploring WiFi enabled chips like [NodeMCU](https://www.nodemcu.com/index_en.html) (esp8266) to integrate with [Arduino IoT Cloud](https://create.arduino.cc/iot).  

If you like my ideas, consider follwoing me for more IoT and Embedded based projects.
